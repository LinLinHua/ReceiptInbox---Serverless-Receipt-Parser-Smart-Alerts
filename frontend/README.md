## Follow these steps to do simple frontend testing:

1. start (test) server: python test/server.py
2. install required js packages: npm install
3. start frontend web app: npm start
4. do functionality test on web page
5. check python server logs and browser console messages

## Current progress

-   basic frame/implementation for most planned functionalities
-   capable of transfering (image) files through 'axios'

## TODO

-   test with deployed server to ensure basic functionality
-   complete 'Statistic' tab (present the analysis info passed by backend)
-   add more functionalities: verify upload files (text extraction), modify uploaded data before being fed to ML module for analysis
